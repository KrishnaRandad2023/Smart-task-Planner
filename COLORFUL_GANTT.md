# 🎨 Colorful Gantt Chart - Each Task Gets Its Own Color!

## What's New

✅ **Every task now has a unique, vibrant color!**

Instead of all tasks being the same color based on priority, each task now gets its own distinct color from a beautiful 14-color palette. This makes it incredibly easy to visually separate and track individual tasks across the timeline.

## 🌈 Color Palette (14 Unique Colors)

Each task is assigned one of these vibrant colors in rotation:

1. 🔵 **Blue** - First task
2. 🟣 **Purple** - Second task
3. 🌸 **Pink** - Third task
4. 🌹 **Rose** - Fourth task
5. 🟠 **Orange** - Fifth task
6. 🟡 **Amber** - Sixth task
7. 🟢 **Lime** - Seventh task
8. 💚 **Emerald** - Eighth task
9. 🐚 **Teal** - Ninth task
10. 🔷 **Cyan** - Tenth task
11. ☁️ **Sky** - Eleventh task
12. 💙 **Indigo** - Twelfth task
13. 💜 **Violet** - Thirteenth task
14. 🎀 **Fuchsia** - Fourteenth task

If you have more than 14 tasks, the colors cycle back to the beginning!
