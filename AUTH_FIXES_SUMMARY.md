# Authentication Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Login Required After Each Task Generation**

**Problem**: After successfully logging in and generating one task, the system was asking for login again for subsequent task generations.

**Root Cause**:

- The `sessionStorage` flag was being removed too early after first use
- The `isGeneratingAfterAuth.current` bypass flag was being reset after successful generation
- Authentication check was too strict, requiring user state even when auth cookie existed

**Solution**:

- Simplified authentication check to prioritize auth cookie presence
- Removed sessionStorage dependency (no longer needed)
- Keep bypass flag set as long as auth cookie exists
- Only reset bypass flag on actual 401 authentication errors
- Check auth cookie in multiple places: TaskPlanner, UserMenu, TaskHistory

### 2. **Database Name Inconsistency (Root Cause of Previous Issues)**

**Problem**: User data was being saved to one database but read from another.

**Root Cause**:

- `send-otp` and `verify-otp` routes used `"smart-task-planner"` database
- `auth/me` and all other routes used `"taskplanner"` database
- Users couldn't be found during authentication checks

**Solution**:

- Changed all routes to consistently use `"taskplanner"` database
- All 16 database references now point to the same database

### 3. **Task History Not Loading**

**Problem**: Task history page wouldn't load or show tasks after login.

**Root Cause**:

- Component only checked `user` state, not auth cookie
- Auth state might not be loaded yet when component renders
- No proper error handling for unauthenticated state

**Solution**:

- Check both `user` state AND auth cookie presence
- Fetch history if either exists (cookie-based auth fallback)
- Added proper auth error state and message
- Improved loading states and error handling

### 4. **User Avatar Not Appearing After Login**

**Problem**: Header still showed "Login" button even after successful authentication.

**Root Cause**:

- UserMenu only checked user state, not auth cookie
- No mechanism to refresh auth state when cookie exists but user state doesn't

**Solution**:

- Check for auth cookie in UserMenu
- Auto-trigger auth state refresh when cookie exists but user is null
- Show loading spinner during refresh

## Files Modified

1. **components/task-planner.tsx**

   - Simplified auth check logic
   - Removed sessionStorage dependency
   - Keep bypass flag active as long as auth cookie exists
   - Only reset on actual 401 errors

2. **components/task-history.tsx**

   - Added auth cookie fallback check
   - Improved auth error handling
   - Better loading states
   - Fetch history based on cookie OR user state

3. **components/user-menu.tsx**

   - Check auth cookie in addition to user state
   - Auto-refresh auth state when cookie exists
   - Better state synchronization

4. **app/api/auth/send-otp/route.ts**

   - Changed from `db("smart-task-planner")` to `db("taskplanner")`

5. **app/api/auth/verify-otp/route.ts**
   - Changed from `db("smart-task-planner")` to `db("taskplanner")`

## Testing Checklist

✅ **Login Flow**

- [ ] Login with email and OTP works
- [ ] User avatar appears immediately after login
- [ ] No "Login" button shown after successful authentication

✅ **Task Generation**

- [ ] First task generation works without re-login
- [ ] Second and subsequent task generations work without re-login
- [ ] Can generate multiple tasks in same session

✅ **Task History**

- [ ] Task history page loads after login
- [ ] Shows all previously generated tasks
- [ ] Can expand/collapse task details
- [ ] Refresh button works

✅ **Session Persistence**

- [ ] Page refresh keeps user logged in
- [ ] User avatar persists after refresh
- [ ] Task history accessible after refresh
- [ ] Can generate tasks after page refresh without re-login

✅ **Error Handling**

- [ ] Proper error message when not authenticated
- [ ] Auth modal appears when needed
- [ ] No infinite loops or repeated auth prompts

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Priority Order

1. **Cookie-First Approach**: Check for `auth-token` cookie presence
2. **State Fallback**: Check user state from AuthContext
3. **Bypass Flag**: Use `isGeneratingAfterAuth` ref for immediate post-login actions

### Key Principles

- **Cookie as Source of Truth**: If auth cookie exists, user is authenticated
- **Persistent Bypass Flag**: Keep flag set as long as cookie exists
- **Proactive State Refresh**: Auto-refresh auth state when cookie exists but user state is null
- **Database Consistency**: All routes use same database name

### Debug Console Logs

Added console logs at key points:

- `TaskPlanner`: Shows auth check details before generation
- `TaskHistory`: Shows auth status when component loads
- `UserMenu`: Shows when auto-refreshing auth state

## Performance Improvements

- Reduced unnecessary auth checks
- Eliminated sessionStorage reads/writes
- Better cookie-based authentication (faster than API calls)
- Smoother user experience with fewer API roundtrips

## Security Notes

- All auth checks still validate JWT tokens on server side
- Cookie-based checks are UI optimization only
- Server-side routes still require valid auth-token cookie
- No security compromises made for UX improvements
