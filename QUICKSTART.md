   - Copy connection string
   - Add: `MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...`

   - Save the file

## Example Goals to Try

- "Launch a product in 2 weeks"
- "Learn React and build a portfolio in 3 months"
- "Plan a wedding in 6 months"
- "Write and publish a book in 1 year"
- "Start a podcast with weekly episodes"
- "Organize a company team-building event"
- "Create a YouTube channel and reach 1000 subscribers"

## Troubleshooting

### "Gemini API key is not configured"

- Make sure you've added your Gemini API key to `.env.local`
- Restart the dev server after adding the key

### "Database is not configured" (Optional)

- MongoDB is optional but recommended
- Add your MongoDB Atlas connection string to use database features
- The app will work without MongoDB, but plans won't be saved

### Dependencies issues

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Port 3000 already in use

```bash
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```
